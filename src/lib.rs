//! Stream abstraction for rotor
//!
//! The crate provides:
//!
//! * Buffering for network sockets
//! * Simple abstractions like read N bytes, read until '\n'
//! * Persistent (auto-reconnecting) client connections
//! * Abstraction for accepting connection on server-side
//!
//! Assumptions for streams:
//!
//! 1. You read data by length-prefixed or fixed-string-delimited chunks rather
//!    than byte-by-byte
//! 2. Each chunk fits memory
//! 3. Your data stream is not entirely full-duplex: while you can read and
//!    write simultaneously, when you apply pushback (i.e. waiting for bytes to
//!    be flushed), you can't do reads [*]
//!
//! [*] This matches HTTP perfectly, and most bidirectional interactive
//!     workflows (including based on websockets). But for some cases may be
//!     hard to implement. One such case is when you need to generate some
//!     output stream (you can't buffer it), and have to parse input stream at
//!     the same time.
